### WorldPredownload v1.4.8
- Fixed 1108 compatibility. A good chunk of the mod was rewritten to support this build
this introduces possibly more bugs/problems from my end as the mod now handles 
  all of the downloading process including the post file processing. If there 
  are any issues let me know.

### ActionMenuUtils v1.3.9
- Fixed compatibility problems with Build 1106

### WorldPredownload v1.4.7

### WorldPredownload v1.4.6
- Build 1101 compatibility fix

### WorldPredownload v1.4.5

### WorldPredownload v1.4.2

- Fixed Invite Button Ui Tooltip Text
- Removed Components (VRChat cloned one of them 100 times 👀). This should make the mod just that little bit more optimized.
- Fixed Dismiss Popup XRef failing
- Added a new setting to hide "Not Downloading" text when not downloading
- Cache will only be fetched once now (on start up) (again, it makes the mod just that little bit more optimized) It'll add other worlds you download while playing through the use of magic.

- Fixed "Go to world page" button on popup throwing an exception

### WorldPredownload v1.3.4

- Yeeted the override settings because it was hurting my head 

### WorldPredownload v1.3.2.1 

- Popup will no longer show when you have a worldInfo page or userinfo open in the menu as you can see download status there 
- Mod will now check to see if the world has been downloaded previously except on invite notification menu
